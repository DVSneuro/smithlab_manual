# Smith Lab Manual

This is the lab manual for the [Smith Lab][lab]. Although it should work for any LaTeX compiler, I am new to LaTeX and I have been primarily using TeXShop and the [MacTeX distribution][mactex]. You may need to install the [Memoir package][memoir] and the [Academicons package][academicons].

Much of the material in this lab manual was taken from [Jonathan Peelle's lab manual][peelle-manual]. For more information about the value of a lab manual, see [Dr. Peelle's blog][peelle-blog].
